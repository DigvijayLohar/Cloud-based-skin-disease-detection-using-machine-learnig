# Cloud-based-skin-disease-detection-using-machine-learnig
**Abstract**
    
    Skin disease is a health problem that affects millions of people worldwide every year. Timely and accurate diagnosis is important for effective treatment and control of these diseases. However, access to dermatologists may be limited in many areas, resulting in delays in diagnosis and possible health risks. To solve this challenge, the combination of cloud computing and machine learning (ML) technology holds great promise. This project aims to revolutionize the diagnosis of skin diseases by using a learning climate model to make diagnosis easier, more accurate and accessible to everyone.

**Database Image:** Our online database option for this project is MongoDB,
which arranges data according to key-value pairs. User-entered data is safely
saved in the online MongoDB database upon registration. Because it
contains the registered user data, this database plays a vital role in user
authentication by facilitating easy authentication procedures.
Additionally, the MongoDB database improves flexibility and accessibility
to important information by enabling administrators to access data from
distant locations. In addition, we have a different database in place to handle
contact information that is intended to hold user inquiries and associated
data.
